# Test-Repository
First GitHub project. (Demo Structure)

This is going to be my first attempt to understand this intuitive platform github. My journey in data science is currently based on my understanding of statistical and mathematical concepts. I consider myself to be prepared for the path ahead and I'm confident, using R and Python, i'll be able to answer complex business questions. Already familiar with excel and the associated benefits of having excel as a backup.
